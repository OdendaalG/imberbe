                    Imberbe is a private wildlife reserve located in the Balule reserve, in the South African Lowveld. It is a
                    big 5 reserve, adjoining and open to the Klaserie game reserve and the bigger Kruger National Park. This
                    exclusive and privately owned reserve is an undeveloped reserve and is home to the undisturbed natural
                    beauty and wildlife of the Lowveld.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Imberbe is 1246 hectares in size, and to the south of Imberde borders the Olifants River Game reserve and
                    on the eastern side Klaserie game reserve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The more than 50km of gravel and grass game drive trails crosses through the reserve and have been
                    carefully planned to not disturb the pristine nature and wildlife. 2 solar powered water holes provide
                    relief for wildlife that passes through. 5 km to the north flows the Olifants river to the east coast and
                    to the south of Imberbe is “Double dam” that is fed from storm water run-off.
